# Spanish-visa-bot
Because of the high demand, small number of slots and inability to manually make an appointment for a visa to Spain, it became necessary to write code for the bot, which will monitor the availability of slots in the embassy. 



I am an hobbyist, not a professional developer.
I developed this bot for myself and it is currently in the testing phase, but it has already helped me make an appointment with the embassy. For questions to this bot. 

If you have any questions about this bot, I will try to answer them.
